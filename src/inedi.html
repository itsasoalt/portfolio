    <h1>Personal Portfolio 2014</h1>

      <section>
        <p>I stated myself as a designer with this personal portfolio design: go BIG or go home.</p>
        <p>This was my final project of my introduction course to HTML/CSS and I wanted to use all the features I’ve learnt in class.</p>
        <p>I didn’t pay too much attention to the design or content, I actually wanted it to be very visual and I wanted it to offer a experience to the viewer.</p>
        <p>As I wanted to go big on my design, I went BIG on my mistakes too.</p>

        <blockquote>I wanted my portfolio to be responsive and cool that when performing it was almost frozen.</blockquote>

      <section class="color-four full-width">
        <ul>
          <li>As I’ve said, I didn’t pay enough attention to the content. My photos were very high quality and damaged the performance of the full web.</li>
          <li>There were some things I didn’t know how to do, and I did them anyway. When the responsive design changed the layout and placed the items en different ways I just sticked to the “do not show”, but it didn’t mean that they would “not charge”. Again, I was unconsciously damaging my personal portfolio website’s performance.</li>
          <li>I don’t consider myself a graphic designer and I don’t particularly enjoy it, this time I had to do my own identity and couldn’t be less coherent. I created every item thinking of how I wanted to style them and how they would look good on the web, but I didn’t think of the brand itself.</li>
