        <p>Hi! I am Itsaso and I am a designer. I graduated from Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering back in 2014, ever since I’ve been into web design. Now, I am currently studying a Web Design Master Studies.</p>
        <p>I really like web design because allows me to be part of the entire design process, since the very beginning when the idea is created until the final product is released.</p>
        <p>The high speed the web design field develops at fascinates me. The fast evolution, the way prototypes can be created, the information… Web design is so exciting to me. In web design the future is now, and I am part of it.</p>
        <p>I think that web design blurs the line between product and service and appeals to creativity because it doesn’t settle the designer on the drawing board.</p>

        <p>I want to think of myself as a passionate designer: I love color, I love experimenting, I love answering needs users didn’t know they had and I love being surrounded by people passionate like me and working as a team. I deeply believe in teamwork and feel the most confortable when I’m supported by a group.</p>
