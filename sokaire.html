      <section>
        <p>Designing and HTML/CSS coding SOKAIRE’s webpage was my first experience freelancing in partnership with a fellow designer and friend Janire Dosantos. We wanted to offer all we were able to do, and so we did.</p>
        <p>I think of this experience as the most valuable I’ve had up to now, because it was my first job as a wed designer and I did all the mistakes I had been warned not to do, I guess that I didn’t want to let any for the future.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I didn’t meet the client. I made a personal note not to allow this again. But I sincerely trusted my design partner Janire and I thought I had no need to meet the client.</li>
          <li>We worked as the very next day was the deadline, but we lacked an awful lot of information and real content. The client wanted everything ASAP, but they wouldn’t handle us the content we required on time.</li>
          <li>We didn’t prototype. Because of this we did a lot of waste work. HTML/CSS programming that we has to undo, redo, change… If I had known all I know now I would have spent a third of my time prototyping, a third waiting for the real content and a third actually coding.</li>
          <li>We sticked to what we already knew, we didn’t try something new when designing. This led us to a crazy spaghetti HTML/CSS coding and not to learn any further coding resources.</li>
