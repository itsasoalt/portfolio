        <p>I have always tried to do my best in class, but probably during the NAOW workshop I learnt a hundred times more. If I had to think of a “worst case scenario” project, I would immediately think of NAOW. But yet, one of the coolest experiences I’ve had.</p>
        <p>Worst case scenario: Friday, 2h to leave, half of the group missing and who remained weren’t willing to work. So we role-played a Web Design Studio: the teacher played our client, students acted as graphic designers, content creators and programmers, I was the project manager.</p>
        <p>The assignment was to design a web-app to find and share cool activities to do in Bilbao, some kind of social network.</p>
        <p>Well, I was in charge. And for everything I did right I made a mistake.</p>

          <li>I used the whiteboard to organize the steps, to list the folder system, to take down important notes so everyone could see them. Surprisingly, nobody was used to work as a team and they just focused on their task and never checked the whiteboard.</li>
          <li>I set people in pairs to work so they could discuss ideas and feel supported when working. This was a good idea that led to a bad result: they sat on pairs with a single computer and discuss endlessly.</li>
          <li>As I believe that communication is key and I wanted to ensure it, I checked everyone, reminded the color or font in use, helped them make a decision… I was really excited, but I wasn’t able to share my positive feelings, my team and I weren’t on the same page.</li>
          <li>We didn’t finish the assignment on time. But it’s all right, because I trusted my team and our abilities. I take that with me for the future.</li>
