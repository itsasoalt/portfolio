    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <article>

      <section>
        <p>My Portfolio summarizes my very favorite projects and points out which mistakes I made and what I learnt. Because this is the design process for me: doing my best and trying to improve every time.</p>

        <blockquote>There are so many things I’ve done wrong yet, that I’ve learnt much more than if I’d had them well the first time.</blockquote>

          <h3>Sokaire</h3>
          <p>Web design and programming in partnership with a fellow designer and friend. Clients, communication, mock-ups and deadlines: so many basic mistakes. Yet a great experience.</p>

          <h3>Personal Portfolio</h3>
          <p>Design projects up to 2014 summarized in a web portfolio that can be only described as “go big or go home”: big on the design I wanted to achive and big on the basic web performance mistakes I made.</p>

          <h3>Naow</h3>
          <p>Web app design and programming workshop in class. The teacher pretended to be a client, students pretended to be a company and I pretended to be the project manager!</p>
          <p>Leadership, respect, organization and getting things done: I love teamwork, but it doesn’t mean anything if I can’t get the team to work.</p>
